# Project Fork Information

This project is a fork of [CustomHUD](https://github.com/Minenash/CustomHUD) by [Minenash](https://github.com/Minenash).

I use this fork to distribute it in my modpack [AchieveToDo](https://modrinth.com/modpack/achievetodo), since I need a guarantee that the file will not be lost, I forked it and posted the jar.
